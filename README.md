#README

This was a final semester project of my freshman year at SIIT, Thammasat University. What I've created is a remake of the classic game Pong using Java.

I have several classes which are demonstrated in the .png files if you wish to see.

To run the code, the easiest method is the import the whole thing to an IDE, the one I used is ECLIPSE, then run the GameSetup.java found in the 'Setup' Package. After selecting the appropriate settings you can start the game.
